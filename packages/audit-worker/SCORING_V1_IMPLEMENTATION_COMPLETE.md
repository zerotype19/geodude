# Scoring V1 Implementation - Complete âœ…

## What Was Implemented

This implementation adds **11 deterministic, HTML-based scoring checks** that run on every crawled page during audits.

### New Files Created

```

### Modified Files

1. **`package.json`** - Added `linkedom` dependency
2. **`wrangler.toml`** - Added `SCORING_V1_ENABLED = "true"` flag
3. **`src/index.ts`** - Wired scoring into crawl pipeline (line ~2640)
4. **`src/lib/checksMetadata.ts`** - Added metadata for new check IDs

---

## The 11 Checks

All checks are **page-level** (`scope: "page"`) and return scores 0-100:

| Check ID | Category | What It Does |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| `C1_title_quality` | Technical Foundations | Title length, brand presence |
| `C2_meta_description` | Technical Foundations | Meta description exists & length |
| `C3_h1_presence` | Structure & Organization | Single H1 tag |
| `A1_answer_first` | Content & Clarity | Hero section with value prop + CTA |
| `A2_headings_semantic` | Structure & Organization | Proper H1â†’H2â†’H3 hierarchy |
| `A3_faq_presence` | Content & Clarity | FAQ section detected |
| `A4_schema_faqpage` | Technical Foundations | Valid FAQPage JSON-LD |
| `A9_internal_linking` | Structure & Organization | Internal link count & diversity |
| `G10_canonical` | Technical Foundations | Canonical tag correctness |
| `T1_mobile_viewport` | Experience & Performance | Mobile viewport meta tag |
| `T2_lang_region` | Technical Foundations | HTML lang attribute |
| `T3_noindex_robots` | Crawl & Discoverability | No blocking robots meta |
| `A12_entity_graph` | Authority & Trust | Organization schema completeness |

## How It Works

### 1. During Crawl (Automatic)

When a page is analyzed, if `SCORING_V1_ENABLED="true"`:

```typescript
// After audit_page_analysis is inserted...
await scoreAndPersistPage(db, page, site);
```

- Runs on `html_rendered` (if available), falls back to `html_static`
- Executes all 11 checks in <50ms
- Stores results in `audit_page_analysis.checks_json` as JSON

**Example `checks_json` output:**

```json
[
  {
    "id": "C1_title_quality",
    "scope": "page",
    "score": 85,
    "status": "ok",
    "details": { "title": "Acme Widgets â€” Official", "length": 24, "hasBrand": true },
    "evidence": ["Acme Widgets â€” Official"]
  },
  {
    "id": "T1_mobile_viewport",
    "scope": "page",
    "score": 100,
    "status": "ok",
    "details": { "content": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1" }
  }
  // ... 11 more checks
]
```

### 2. In API Responses (Automatic)

Existing endpoints already return `checks_json`:

- `GET /api/audits/:id` â†’ includes enriched checks with metadata
- `GET /api/audits/:id/pages` â†’ includes `checks_json` per page
- `GET /api/audits/:id/pages/:pageId` â†’ full page details with checks

The **Scorecard V2** enrichment logic automatically picks up new checks and adds:
- `category` (from CHECKS_METADATA)
- `impact_level` (High/Medium/Low)
- `why_it_matters` (plain-language explanation)
- `weight` (for rollups)

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd packages/audit-worker
pnpm install
```

### 2. Run Smoke Tests

```bash
pnpm exec vitest run scoring.smoke
```

Expected: âœ… All 6 test suites pass

### 3. Deploy to Staging

```bash
pnpm run deploy
```

The system is **enabled by default** (`SCORING_V1_ENABLED="true"` in `wrangler.toml`).

### 4. Verify in Production

1. Start a new audit
2. Check `audit_page_analysis.checks_json` in the database
3. Verify API responses include the new check IDs

```sql
SELECT checks_json FROM audit_page_analysis LIMIT 1;
```

Should return JSON with 13 checks (old + new).

### 5. Update Frontend (Optional)

The existing UI should automatically display new checks if it reads from `checks_json`. You may want to:

- Add visual indicators for `scope: "page"` vs. future `scope: "site"`
- Show "Active checks: X/Y" per page
- Filter by check category in scorecard view

---

## Rollup & Category Scoring

The existing `computeCategoryScores()` function in `lib/categoryScoring.ts` will automatically:

1. Read `checks_json` from each page
2. Group by `category` (from CHECKS_METADATA)
3. Compute averages **only for present checks**
4. Exclude categories with 0 active checks

**No changes needed** â€” the new checks integrate seamlessly.

---

## Feature Flag

To disable scoring (e.g., during debugging):

```toml
# wrangler.toml
SCORING_V1_ENABLED = "false"
```

Or per-request via environment variable override.

---

## Future: Site-Level Checks

This implementation supports **page-level checks only** (`scope: "page"`).

For site-level aggregates (e.g., "FAQ coverage across all pages"), add a post-crawl step:

1. Read all `checks_json` rows for an audit
2. Compute site-wide metrics (e.g., % of pages with valid FAQPage schema)
3. Store in `audits.metadata` or new `audit_summary` table
4. Mark as `scope: "site"` in UI

The `scope` field is already present in the check output to prepare for this.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Module not found: linkedom"

```bash
cd packages/audit-worker
pnpm install linkedom
```

### Checks not appearing in API

1. Verify `SCORING_V1_ENABLED="true"` in wrangler.toml
2. Check logs for `[SCORING_V1] Scored page: ...`
3. Query database: `SELECT checks_json FROM audit_page_analysis WHERE page_id = '...'`

### Tests failing

Ensure you're in the correct directory:

```bash
cd packages/audit-worker
pnpm exec vitest run scoring.smoke
```
