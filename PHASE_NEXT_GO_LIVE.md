## 📈 72-Hour Monitoring Plan

### Day 1 (First 24h)
**Focus**: System stability, error detection

- [ ] Monitor worker logs every 4 hours
- [ ] Check for any 500 errors
- [ ] Verify new audits complete successfully
- [ ] Confirm new checks (A12, C1, G11, G12) populate
- [ ] Watch for Vectorize write errors

**Commands:**
```bash
# Watch logs
npx wrangler tail --format=pretty | grep -i "error"

# Check recent audits
curl https://api.optiview.ai/v1/audits?limit=10
```

### Day 2 (24-48h)
**Focus**: Cron job execution, data quality

- [ ] Verify MVA cron ran successfully (check logs at 2 AM)
- [ ] Verify recommendations cron ran (check logs at 3 AM)
- [ ] Spot-check 3 domains for score accuracy
- [ ] Test MVA endpoint returns valid data
- [ ] Check citation aggregation working

**Commands:**
```bash
# Check MVA cron logs
npx wrangler tail --format=pretty | grep "MVA"

# Check recommendations logs
npx wrangler tail --format=pretty | grep "Nearest Winner"
```

### Day 3 (48-72h)
**Focus**: Feature validation, user feedback

- [ ] Export first MVA trend report
- [ ] Validate recommendation quality
- [ ] Check citation match rates (>95% expected)
- [ ] Confirm no performance degradation
- [ ] Gather initial user feedback

**Metrics to Track:**
- Audit completion time (target: <2 min)
- API response time (target: <500ms)
- Vectorize write success rate (target: >95%)
- MVA computation time (target: <5 min)
- Recommendation match rate (target: >80%)

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria (Week 1)

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] 100+ audits with new checks (A12, C1, G11, G12)
- [ ] Zero production errors
- [ ] All cron jobs executing successfully
- [ ] Vectorize health >95%
- [ ] API p95 latency <500ms

### Business Metrics
- [ ] MVA trends visible for top 10 projects
- [ ] Recommendations generated for >80% uncited pages
- [ ] User feedback positive (no major complaints)
- [ ] Score Guide usage >50% of users

---

## 🔄 Rollback Procedure (If Needed)

If critical issues arise, execute immediately:

```bash
# 1. Disable scoring flags
cd packages/audit-worker
# Edit wrangler.toml:
PHASE_NEXT_SCORING="false"
MVA_ENABLED="false"
LEARNING_LOOP_ENABLED="false"

# 2. Redeploy worker
npx wrangler deploy

# 3. Monitor recovery
npx wrangler tail | grep "Phase Next"
```

**Rollback is non-destructive:**
- Database changes persist (no data loss)
- UI continues to work (degrades gracefully)
- Existing audits unaffected

---

## 📝 Known Limitations (Current)

1. **Preview Badges**: Still showing on A12, C1, G11, G12
   - **Action**: Remove after 1 week validation
   
2. **Backfill Scripts**: Not yet run
   - **Action**: Run `upsert-criteria` and `backfill-rollups` after validation

3. **Vectorize Index**: Empty initially
   - **Action**: Will populate as audits run

4. **MVA Trends**: Need 7 days of data
   - **Action**: Wait for data accumulation
