**Status:** ✅ **DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION**

**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**New Canonical URL:** https://optiview.ai/citations

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully consolidated multiple citations guide pages into one comprehensive, authoritative guide at a single canonical URL. The new guide showcases Optiview's advanced self-learning citation intelligence system, including 200+ industry taxonomies, context-aware query generation, and the Prompt Intelligence Index.

## What Changed

### **Before: Fragmented Documentation**

Citations documentation was scattered across three locations:
1. `/docs/citations.html` - Basic overview page on marketing site
2. `/help/citations` (app route) - Technical deep dive with self-learning system details
3. `/faq/citations.html` - FAQ-style explanations

**Problems:**
- Users had to navigate multiple pages for complete information
- Inconsistent messaging and feature coverage
- No single "source of truth" for citations intelligence
- Internal linking confusion
- Duplicate content maintenance

### **After: Single Comprehensive Guide**

New canonical URL: **`https://optiview.ai/citations`**

One authoritative page covering:
- Self-learning citation intelligence overview
- 200+ industry taxonomies with hierarchical classification
- Context-aware query generation (v4-llm system)
- Prompt Intelligence Index and flywheel effect
- Query types (branded/non-branded with examples)
- AI platforms tracked (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Brave)
- Industry-specific examples across 5 verticals
- Advanced intelligence features (3-tier caching, semantic discovery)
- Results interpretation and metrics
- Optimization strategies
- API access documentation

## Content Highlights

### **Why This System Is Different**

The page explicitly explains how Optiview's approach differs from traditional tools:

| Traditional Tools | Optiview |
|-------------------|----------|
| Static templates | Context-aware learning |
| Robotic queries | Human-realistic generation |
| One-size-fits-all | Industry-specific taxonomies |
| No improvement | Continuous learning |
| Generic results | Semantic intelligence |

### **Flywheel Effect**

Clearly communicates the network effect:
> "Each audit makes the next one smarter. The system learns which query patterns yield genuine citations, which brand formulations AI platforms recognize, and which content structures maximize visibility—then applies those insights across all future audits."

### **Competitive Intelligence**

Highlights advanced features:
- Find competitors by entity overlap
- Benchmark citation performance
- Discover emerging topic trends
- Identify content gaps

---

## Metrics to Track

### **Engagement**
- Time on page
- Scroll depth
- Click-through to "Start Tracking Your Citations" CTA
- Bounce rate vs old pages

### **SEO**
- Organic impressions for:
  - "AI citation tracking"
  - "LLM citation intelligence"
  - "Self-learning citation system"
  - "Industry-specific citation testing"
- Ranking position for long-tail queries

### **Conversion**
- Audit starts from citations page
- Sign-ups from citations page CTA
- Citations tab engagement after reading guide

## Next Steps (Optional)

### **1. Add Redirects**

Create `apps/web/public/_redirects`:
```
/docs/citations.html  /citations  301
/faq/citations.html   /citations  301
```

### **2. Delete Old Pages**

Once redirects are in place:
```bash
rm apps/web/public/docs/citations.html
rm apps/web/public/faq/citations.html
```

And deprecate the app route in `apps/app/src/routes/help/citations.tsx`.

### **3. Add Interactive Elements**

Consider adding:
- Expandable taxonomy tree
- Live query generator demo
- Citation rate calculator
- Industry selector tool

### **4. Video Walkthrough**

Embed Loom/YouTube video showing:
