## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Domain Whitelist Accuracy (Should be 100%)

Test that known domains are instantly and correctly classified:

```bash
# Test pharmaceutical companies
curl -X POST https://worker.optiview.ai/api/test-industry \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"domain": "pfizer.com"}'
# Expected: { "industry": "pharmaceutical", "source": "domain_rules", "confidence": 1.0 }

curl -X POST https://worker.optiview.ai/api/test-industry \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"domain": "moderna.com"}'
# Expected: { "industry": "pharmaceutical", "source": "domain_rules", "confidence": 1.0 }

# Test healthcare providers
curl -X POST https://worker.optiview.ai/api/test-industry \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"domain": "mayoclinic.org"}'
# Expected: { "industry": "healthcare_provider", "source": "domain_rules", "confidence": 1.0 }

# Test financial services
curl -X POST https://worker.optiview.ai/api/test-industry \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"domain": "americanexpress.com"}'
# Expected: { "industry": "financial_services", "source": "domain_rules", "confidence": 1.0 }

# Test SaaS/B2B
curl -X POST https://worker.optiview.ai/api/test-industry \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"domain": "salesforce.com"}'
# Expected: { "industry": "saas_b2b", "source": "domain_rules", "confidence": 1.0 }

# Test airlines
curl -X POST https://worker.optiview.ai/api/test-industry \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"domain": "delta.com"}'
# Expected: { "industry": "travel_air", "source": "domain_rules", "confidence": 1.0 }
```

**Success Criteria**: All 300+ whitelisted domains return correct industry with `source: "domain_rules"` and `confidence: 1.0`

---

### Phase 2: Anti-Keyword Filtering (Prevent Misclassification)

Test that anti-keywords prevent incorrect classifications:

#### Test Case 1: Pharmaceutical vs Hospital
```javascript
// Pfizer should NOT be classified as healthcare_provider even if page mentions "patient"
const signals = {
  domain: "pfizer.com",
  homepageTitle: "Pfizer | Patient Support",
  homepageH1: "Helping Patients Access Our Medicines",
  keywords: ["patient", "support", "assistance"]
};

// Expected: "pharmaceutical" (domain whitelist overrides everything)
// Anti-keywords: ["patient portal", "appointment", "emergency room"] should NOT trigger healthcare_provider
```

#### Test Case 2: Hospital vs Pharmaceutical
```javascript
// Mayo Clinic should NOT be classified as pharmaceutical even if page mentions "medication"
const signals = {
  domain: "mayoclinic.org",
  homepageTitle: "Mayo Clinic | Patient Care",
  homepageH1: "Make an Appointment",
  keywords: ["appointments", "doctors", "medication", "treatment"]
};

// Expected: "healthcare_provider"
// Anti-keywords: ["fda approved drug", "clinical trial enrollment"] should NOT trigger pharmaceutical
```

#### Test Case 3: Bank vs Healthcare
```javascript
// Chase should NOT be classified as healthcare even if page mentions "insurance"
const signals = {
  domain: "chase.com",
  homepageTitle: "Chase Bank | Credit Cards & Insurance",
  keywords: ["insurance", "accounts", "loans"]
};

// Expected: "financial_services"
// Anti-keywords: ["patient care", "prescription"] should NOT trigger healthcare
```

**Success Criteria**: Anti-keywords correctly prevent 100% of known misclassification patterns

---

### Phase 3: Query Validation (Reject Incompatible Queries)

Test that generated queries match the industry:

#### Test Case 1: Pharmaceutical Queries
```javascript
const industry = "pharmaceutical";

// SHOULD PASS:
const validQueries = [
  "Pfizer vaccine side effects",
  "Is Moderna's COVID vaccine safe?",
  "Lipitor vs generic alternatives",
  "How does Keytruda work for cancer?",
  "Pfizer drug pricing transparency"
];

// SHOULD FAIL:
const invalidQueries = [
  "Pfizer patient portal access",                // Anti-keyword: "patient portal"
  "Book appointment with Pfizer doctor",         // Anti-keyword: "appointment"
  "Does Pfizer emergency room accept insurance?",// Anti-keyword: "emergency room"
  "Pfizer hospital wait times"                   // Anti-keyword: "hospital"
];
```

#### Test Case 2: Healthcare Provider Queries
```javascript
const industry = "healthcare_provider";

// SHOULD PASS:
const validQueries = [
  "Mayo Clinic appointment scheduling",
  "Does Mayo Clinic accept my insurance?",
  "Mayo Clinic emergency room wait times",
  "Find a doctor at Cleveland Clinic"
];

// SHOULD FAIL:
const invalidQueries = [
  "Mayo Clinic FDA approved drugs",              // Anti-keyword: "fda approved drug"
  "Mayo Clinic prescription drug pricing",       // Anti-keyword: "prescription drug"
  "Join Mayo Clinic clinical trial enrollment"   // Anti-keyword: "clinical trial enrollment"
];
```

**Success Criteria**: 
- Valid queries pass at 95%+ rate
- Invalid queries rejected at 100% rate

---

### Phase 4: Small Business Testing (Edge Cases)

Test classification for unknown domains without whitelist entries:

#### Scenario 1: Local Restaurant
```javascript
const signals = {
  domain: "joespizzeria.com",
  homepageTitle: "Joe's Pizzeria | Best Pizza in Town",
  homepageH1: "View Our Menu",
  navTerms: ["menu", "order online", "locations", "about us"],
  keywords: ["pizza", "italian restaurant", "delivery"]
};

// Expected: "restaurants" (via heuristics)
// Fallback confidence: 0.4-0.7
```

#### Scenario 2: Local Dentist
```javascript
const signals = {
  domain: "smithdental.com",
  homepageTitle: "Smith Family Dental | Your Local Dentist",
  homepageH1: "Schedule Your Appointment",
  navTerms: ["services", "appointments", "patient portal", "contact"],
  keywords: ["dentist", "dental care", "teeth cleaning", "appointments"]
};

// Expected: "healthcare_provider" (via heuristics)
// Key signal: "appointments", "patient portal"
// Fallback confidence: 0.5-0.8
```

#### Scenario 3: Local Plumber
```javascript
const signals = {
  domain: "bobsplumbing.com",
  homepageTitle: "Bob's Plumbing | 24/7 Emergency Service",
  homepageH1: "Call Now for Fast Service",
  navTerms: ["services", "about", "contact", "emergency"],
  keywords: ["plumbing", "emergency", "repair", "service"]
};

// Expected: "generic_consumer" (no strong industry signals)
// Fallback confidence: 0.2-0.4
// Generated queries should be generic: "hours", "service area", "pricing", "reviews"
```

**Success Criteria**: 
- Small businesses with strong industry signals (restaurant menu, dental appointments) → Correct industry at 70%+ confidence
- Small businesses with weak signals (plumber, electrician) → `generic_consumer` with appropriate generic queries

---

### Phase 5: End-to-End Citation Quality

Run full audits and evaluate query quality:

#### Test Domains
1. **Pfizer.com** (pharmaceutical)
   - Expected queries: drug efficacy, side effects, clinical trials, alternatives, pricing
   - Rejected queries: patient portal, emergency room, appointment booking
   
2. **Adobe.com** (saas_b2b)
   - Expected queries: pricing, features, alternatives, integrations, reviews
   - Rejected queries: patient care, prescription, emergency room
   
3. **Chipotle.com** (restaurants)
   - Expected queries: menu, locations, nutrition, delivery, catering
   - Rejected queries: patient portal, fda approved, appointment booking
   
4. **Harvard.edu** (university)
   - Expected queries: admissions, programs, tuition, financial aid, rankings
   - Rejected queries: patient care, retail hours, emergency room

**Evaluation Metrics**:
```javascript
{
  industry_accuracy: ">95% for whitelisted, >70% for small businesses",
  query_relevance: ">90% queries match industry",
  query_rejection_rate: "15-25% (filtering working)",
  query_human_score: ">0.70 average",
  zero_patient_portal_pharma: "true (critical)"
}
```

## 📈 Monitoring & Alerts

### Key Metrics to Track (D1 Queries)

#### 1. Generic Consumer Rate
```sql
-- Should be < 20% for audits created after deploy
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_audits,
  SUM(CASE WHEN industry = 'generic_consumer' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as generic_count,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN industry = 'generic_consumer' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as generic_pct
FROM audits
WHERE created_at >= datetime('now', '-7 days');
```

#### 2. AI Invocation Rate
```sql
-- Should be > 85% (AI being called for non-whitelisted domains)
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total,
  SUM(CASE WHEN industry_source LIKE 'ai_worker%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as ai_classified,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN industry_source LIKE 'ai_worker%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as ai_pct
FROM audits
WHERE created_at >= datetime('now', '-7 days')
  AND industry_source NOT IN ('domain_rules', 'override');
```

#### 3. Top Misclassified Domains
```sql
-- Manual review list
SELECT 
  SUBSTR(root_url, INSTR(root_url, '://') + 3) as domain,
  industry,
  industry_source,
  COUNT(*) as audit_count
FROM audits
WHERE created_at >= datetime('now', '-30 days')
  AND industry = 'generic_consumer'
  AND industry_source != 'default'
GROUP BY domain, industry, industry_source
HAVING audit_count > 1
ORDER BY audit_count DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

#### 4. Query Rejection Rate by Industry
```sql
-- Should see 15-25% rejection (filtering working)
-- Note: This requires logging to a new table (optional enhancement)
SELECT 
  industry,
  COUNT(*) as total_queries,
  SUM(CASE WHEN rejected = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as rejected_count,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN rejected = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as rejection_pct
FROM query_validation_log
WHERE created_at >= datetime('now', '-7 days')
GROUP BY industry
ORDER BY rejection_pct DESC;
```

### Alert Thresholds

| Metric | Warning | Critical |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Generic Consumer Rate | > 25% | > 40% |
| AI Invocation Rate | < 80% | < 60% |
| Query Rejection Rate | < 10% or > 40% | < 5% or > 50% |
| Average Human Score | < 0.65 | < 0.55 |

## 🔧 Manual Spot Check Procedure

### Daily Spot Check (5 minutes)

1. **Check Recent Audits**:
   ```sql
   SELECT 
     id,
     SUBSTR(root_url, INSTR(root_url, '://') + 3) as domain,
     industry,
     industry_source,
     created_at
   FROM audits
   ORDER BY created_at DESC
   LIMIT 20;
   ```

2. **Pick 3 Random Audits** (1 pharma/healthcare, 1 tech, 1 other)

3. **Validate Each**:
   - Industry classification correct? ✅/❌
   - Query sample (first 10):
     - Relevant to industry? ✅/❌
     - Sound human? ✅/❌
     - No anti-keyword violations? ✅/❌

4. **If > 1 failure → investigate immediately**
