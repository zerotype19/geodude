**Subject:** Access to Optiview **Visibility Intelligence** (Beta)

Hi <Name>,

We've enabled the new **Visibility** dashboard for your org. You'll see:

* **Top domains** cited by AI assistants (Perplexity live; ChatGPT/Claude when links present)
* **Daily scores** (0â€“100) and **weekly share-of-voice**
* **Recent citations feed** with sources & timestamps

Getting started (2 min):

1. Open **Insights â†’ Visibility**
2. Switch the assistant chip to explore coverage
3. Click any domain for its score & drift
4. Optional: ask assistants prompts like "Top resources for <topic> (include URLs)" to generate fresh signals

We'll monitor for 72 hours and share a summary. Feedback welcome!

â€” Team Optiview
