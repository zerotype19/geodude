# E-E-A-T & MVA Metrics Guide

## Overview

Phase Next introduces two new scoring systems to help you understand and improve your AI visibility:

- **E-E-A-T Scoring**: Experience, Expertise, Authority, Trust
- **MVA (Multi-Vector Authority)**: Competitive analysis and impression estimation

## E-E-A-T Scoring

### The 5 Pillars

1. **Access & Indexability** (20 points)
   - AI bot access testing
   - Render parity validation
   - Page type classification

2. **Entities & Structured Fitness** (20 points)
   - JSON-LD schema validation
   - Entity recognition
   - Structured data completeness

3. **Answer Fitness** (25 points)
   - Content chunkability
   - Q&A scaffold detection
   - Snippetability analysis

4. **Authority/Safety/Provenance** (20 points)
   - E-E-A-T signal detection
   - Content licensing
   - Source credibility

5. **Performance & Stability** (15 points)
   - Core Web Vitals
   - Page load performance
   - Stability metrics

### Understanding Your Scores

- **90-100**: Excellent - Your content is highly optimized for AI assistants
- **80-89**: Good - Minor improvements needed
- **70-79**: Fair - Several areas need attention
- **60-69**: Poor - Significant optimization required
- **Below 60**: Critical - Major issues preventing AI visibility

## MVA (Multi-Vector Authority)

### What It Measures

MVA analyzes how often your content appears in AI assistant responses compared to competitors.

### Key Metrics

- **MVA Index**: Your relative authority score (0-100)
- **Mentions Count**: How many times you're cited
- **Unique URLs**: Number of different pages cited
- **Impression Estimate**: Estimated monthly AI impressions
- **Competitor Domains**: Who you're competing against

### Interpreting MVA

- **80+**: High authority in your niche
- **60-79**: Strong presence, room for growth
- **40-59**: Moderate visibility
- **20-39**: Low visibility, needs improvement
- **Below 20**: Minimal AI presence

## Dashboard Features

### Visibility Tab

- **Trend Charts**: Track your MVA over time
- **Top Cited Pages**: See which content performs best
- **Competitor Analysis**: Compare against industry leaders
- **Proof Drawer**: View actual AI assistant responses

### Updated Cards

#### Trust Card
- **E-E-A-T Meter**: Visual indicator of your authority signals
- **Bot Statuses**: Shows which AI crawlers can access your site
- **Render Match**: Indicates if AI sees the same content as users

#### Crawlability Card
- **Schema Fit**: JSON-LD validation status
- **Licensing**: Content usage rights
- **Feeds**: RSS/Atom feed discovery
