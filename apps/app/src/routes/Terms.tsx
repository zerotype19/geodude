            <p className="muted leading-relaxed">
              By accessing or using the Optiview platform ("Service," "App," "Site"), you agree to these Terms of Use ("Terms"). 
              If you do not agree, you must discontinue use immediately.

              Optiview is provided by <strong>Optiview.ai LLC</strong> ("Company," "we," "our," or "us") as a data and analytics 
              tool for informational and educational purposes only.

            <p className="muted leading-relaxed">
              Optiview provides visibility insights, audits, heuristic scores, and content optimization suggestions related to{' '}
              <strong>Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)</strong> and <strong>Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)</strong>.
            </p>
            <p className="muted leading-relaxed mt-3">
              These outputs are generated using automated analysis, machine heuristics, and evolving public information. 
              They are intended solely to <strong>inform and guide your independent decision-making</strong> - not to prescribe 
              specific actions or guarantee any particular outcome.

            <p className="muted leading-relaxed mb-3">
              All <strong>scores, rankings, grades, and recommendations</strong> within Optiview represent{' '}
              <strong>heuristic indicators only</strong>. They are <strong>not definitive or authoritative measures</strong> of 
              search engine performance, visibility, or compliance.

                Any "weights," "penalties," or "priorities" are subjective heuristics designed for internal consistency -

              <li>
                Recommendations are <strong>suggested actions</strong> derived from publicly observable trends, leaks, and
