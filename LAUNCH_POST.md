🚀 Optiview Beta is Live — AI Search Readiness, Fully Automated

After months of building, we just launched Optiview — a platform that helps 
you optimize your site for AI search engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and 
Claude.

🔍 What it does:
• Crawls your site like AI agents do
• Scores structure, identity, and content
• Shows where you're already cited (Brave Search)
• Gives entity recommendations (schema.org)
• Public share links for every audit

🧱 Built on Cloudflare:
• Workers (API + collector)
• D1 (SQLite at edge)
• R2 (automated backups)
• Pages (dashboard + marketing)
• KV (rate limiting + cache)

⚡ Zero-downtime features:
• 24-hour citations cache (instant results)
• Nightly R2 backups (disaster recovery)
• Weekly auto-audits (Monday mornings)
• Public status page (real-time health)
• CI smoke tests (auto-verified)

📊 Launch stats:
• 11 documentation files (ops, playbooks, demo scripts)
• 3 executable scripts (launch, verify, restore)
• 8 incident playbooks (< 2 min each)
• 99.9% uptime target (production SLOs)

🎁 What's different:
Traditional SEO optimizes for Google. We optimize for AI agents that answer 
questions directly. It's a fundamentally different approach — structured data, 
citeability, and identity over keywords.

🚀 Launching Optiview — Because AI Doesn't Search Like Google

Here's the problem:
When someone asks ChatGPT or Perplexity about your product, does it know you exist?

Traditional SEO doesn't help. AI agents don't crawl pages the same way. 
They look for structured data, clear identity markers, and citeable content.

That's why we built Optiview.

🔍 How it works:
1. We crawl your site like an AI agent
2. Score your readiness (structure, identity, content)
3. Show where you're already being cited
4. Give you specific fixes to improve

Every audit gets a public share link. No login required.
Perfect for sending to clients, teams, or stakeholders.

⚡ Under the hood:
• Built on Cloudflare's edge network
• Automated backups every night
• 24-hour citations cache (instant results)
• Public status page (real-time monitoring)
• Weekly auto-audits (set and forget)

We're live and accepting beta testers.

Try it: https://app.optiview.ai
Or check the status page: https://optiview.ai/status.html

This is the future of search optimization — and it's very different from what 
came before.

## Post Option C: Behind-the-Scenes (Founder Story)

### Text

```
🚀 We just launched Optiview — and I'm sharing everything

3 months ago, I noticed ChatGPT was getting basic facts about companies wrong.
Not because the info didn't exist — but because it wasn't structured properly.

Traditional SEO optimizes for keyword rankings. AI agents need something different:
• Structured data (JSON-LD, Schema.org)
• Clear identity markers (Who are you? What do you do?)
• Citeable content (Can this be verified?)

So we built Optiview.

📊 What it does:
• Crawls your site like an AI agent
• Scores structure, identity, and content (0-100)
• Shows where you're already cited (Brave Search)
• Gives specific recommendations (not just scores)
• Public share links (no login required)

🧱 How we built it:
• Cloudflare Workers (edge compute)
• D1 Database (SQLite at edge)
• R2 Storage (automated backups)
• 24-hour citations cache (performance)
• Weekly auto-audits (automation)

The whole stack runs at the edge. No servers, no DevOps headaches.

⚡ Launch features:
• Public status page (real-time health)
• Nightly backups (disaster recovery)
• CI smoke tests (auto-verified)
• 11 docs (ops, playbooks, demos)
• 3 scripts (launch, verify, restore)

We're live today and accepting beta testers.

The future of search is conversational, not keyword-based.
We're building the tools to optimize for that future.

## Twitter/X Thread Version (6-8 Tweets)

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
```
🚀 We just launched Optiview — a platform that optimizes your site for 
AI search engines like ChatGPT and Perplexity.

Here's why traditional SEO doesn't work anymore (and what we built instead) 🧵
```

### Tweet 2 (Problem)
```
When someone asks ChatGPT "What does [your company] do?" — does it know?

AI agents don't crawl like Google. They look for:
• Structured data (JSON-LD)
• Clear identity (who/what/where)
• Citeable content (verifiable facts)

Most sites fail at all three.
```

### Tweet 3 (Solution)
```
Optiview crawls your site like an AI agent and gives you a readiness score.

Then shows:
✅ Where you're already cited (Brave Search)
✅ What's missing (specific fixes)
✅ Entity recommendations (schema.org)

Every audit gets a public share link — no login required.
```

### Tweet 4 (Tech Stack)
```
Built entirely on @Cloudflare:
• Workers (API + collector)
• D1 (SQLite at edge)
• R2 (backups)
• Pages (dashboard)
• KV (cache + rate limiting)

Zero servers. Everything at the edge.
Automated backups. Public status page.
```

### Tweet 5 (Features)
```
Launch features:
• 24h citations cache (instant results)
• Weekly auto-audits (set and forget)
• Nightly backups (disaster recovery)
• Public status page (real-time health)
• CI smoke tests (auto-verified)

Production-ready from day one.
```

### Tweet 6 (Demo)
```
Demo in 30 seconds:
1. Run audit on your domain
2. See scores (structure, identity, content)
3. Check Citations tab (Brave results)
4. Copy share link
5. Open in private browser (works!)

Try it: https://app.optiview.ai
```

### Tweet 7 (Why Now)
```
The shift from "search engines" to "answer engines" is happening now.

ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude — they're replacing Google for many queries.

If they can't find/verify your info, you don't exist in their answers.

That's the problem we're solving.
```

### Tweet 8 (CTA)
```
We're live and accepting beta testers.
