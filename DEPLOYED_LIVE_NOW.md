## 🎯 What's Happening Behind the Scenes

Every audit now:
1. Runs classifier v2 automatically
2. Stores results in `audit_page_analysis.metadata.classification_v2`
3. Caches in KV (`optiview:classify:v1:${host}`) for 24h
4. Logs telemetry for health monitoring
5. **Does NOT affect scores or UI** (shadow mode)

---

## 📊 After ~10 Audits

Revisit health dashboard to see:
- `cache_hit_rate` climbing (target: ≥80%)
- `total_classifications` increasing
- Agreement rates populating (target: 80%/70%)
- Error rate staying low (target: <0.5%)

---

## 🔍 What to Report

### Good (Expected)
- ✅ site_type/industry generally match legacy
- ✅ site_mode sensible (brand_store, docs_site, etc.)
- ✅ confidence ≥0.7
- ✅ lang/region detected
- ✅ category_terms brand-accurate

### Paste Me This (If Issues)
```bash
curl -s "https://api.optiview.ai/api/admin/classifier-compare?host=PROBLEM_DOMAIN.com" | jq
```

I'll give you the exact weight adjustment!

---

## 🚨 Emergency Rollback

If classifier crashes audits (unlikely):

```bash
# Disable shadow mode
cd packages/audit-worker
wrangler secret put CLASSIFIER_V2_ENABLED
# Enter: 0

# Or rollback worker version
wrangler rollback
```

---

## 🎉 Summary

**Classifier v2 is live in shadow mode!**

- Zero risk (no UI/score changes)
- Collecting data automatically
- Ready for comparison after first audit
- Go/No-Go decision in 48-72h

**Start testing!** 🚀

## 📞 Next Check-in

After you've run 8-12 audits, paste me:
1. Health dashboard screenshot/JSON
2. Any compare results that look "off"
3. Overall impression (confidence, agreement, etc.)

Then we'll decide: tune weights, enable Phase 2 (AI), or promote to Phase 3 (use for prompts).
