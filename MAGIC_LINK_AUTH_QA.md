# Magic Link Authentication - QA Checklist

**Date:** 2025-10-19  
**Status:** Ready for Testing  
**Version:** v1.0

---

## üß™ Test Scenarios

### 1. New Audit (Happy Path) ‚úÖ

**Steps:**
1. Go to `https://app.optiview.ai`
2. Click "Start New Audit"
3. Fill in:
   - Project ID: `test_project`
   - Root URL: `example.com`
   - Site Description: "A sample website for testing"
4. Click "Continue ‚Üí"
5. Enter email address
6. Click "Send Magic Link"
7. Check email inbox
8. Click the magic link within 20 minutes

**Expected Result:**
- Redirected to `/auth/check-email`
- Email received with branded magic link
- Clicking link redirects to `/audits/:id`
- Cookie `ov_sess` is set (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax)
- Audit is created with `user_id` tied to email
- Audit status is `running`

---

### 2. Returning Visit ‚úÖ

**Steps:**
1. After completing test #1, close browser
2. Reopen browser and go to `https://app.optiview.ai/audits`

**Expected Result:**
- No prompt for authentication
- Audit list shows only audits for your email
- User email displayed in navigation header
- "Sign out" button visible

---

### 3. Start Audit Requires Fresh Link ‚úÖ

**Steps:**
1. With valid cookie (from test #1), click "Start New Audit" again
2. Fill in audit details
3. Click "Continue ‚Üí"
4. Enter email (same or different)
5. Click "Send Magic Link"

**Expected Result:**
- Still sends email with magic link
- Does NOT create audit immediately (waits for verification)
- User must click the link to create the audit
- This ensures step-up auth for sensitive actions

---

### 4. Deep Link (Existing Audit) ‚úÖ

**Steps:**
1. From audit list, find an audit you own
2. Have the backend send a secure link using `intent: "open_audit"` (or manually craft the endpoint)
3. Sign out
4. Click the deep link

**Expected Result:**
- Magic link sent to your email
- Clicking link redirects to `/audits/:id`
- Cookie refreshed
- Audit ownership verified (no 403)

---

### 5. Ownership Verification ‚úÖ

**Steps:**
1. Create an audit as user A (email-a@test.com)
2. Sign out
3. Sign in as user B (email-b@test.com)
4. Attempt to access user A's audit by ID (e.g., `/audits/:id-from-user-a`)

**Expected Result:**
- User B should NOT see user A's audit in their list
- Direct access to user A's audit should fail gracefully (redirect or 403)

---

### 6. Expired/Invalid Token ‚úÖ

**Steps:**
1. Request a magic link
2. Wait 20+ minutes OR tamper with token
3. Click the link

**Expected Result:**
- Redirected to `/auth/error?reason=expired_or_invalid`
- Error page shows:
  - "Sign-in link expired"
  - Explanation of 20-minute expiry
  - "Request a new link" button

---

### 7. Missing Token ‚úÖ

**Steps:**
1. Manually navigate to `/auth/callback` without `?token=...` parameter

**Expected Result:**
- Redirected to `/auth/error?reason=missing`
- Error page shows:
  - "Missing sign-in link"
  - "Request a new link" button

---

### 8. Rate Limiting ‚úÖ

**Steps:**
1. Request magic links for the same email 6+ times within 1 hour

**Expected Result:**
- First 5 requests succeed
- 6th request:
  - API returns 200 (to prevent enumeration)
  - But NO email is sent (rate limited)
  - Backend logs rate limit hit
- Only the last valid link (from request 5) works

---

### 9. Multiple Sessions ‚úÖ

**Steps:**
1. Sign in on Chrome (get session cookie)
2. Sign in on Firefox with same email (get separate session cookie)
3. Access audits on both browsers

**Expected Result:**
- Both sessions work independently
- Each has its own `session.id` in the database
- Signing out on one does NOT affect the other

---

### 10. Sign Out ‚úÖ

**Steps:**
1. Sign in and access audits
2. Click "Sign out" button

**Expected Result:**
- `POST /v1/auth/logout` is called
- Session is deleted from `sessions` table
- Cookie is cleared (`Max-Age=0`)
- User is redirected to homepage
- Accessing `/audits` again requires re-authentication

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Backend Validation

### Database Checks

After running tests, verify in D1:

```sql
-- Check users table
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Check magic tokens (should have used_at timestamp)
SELECT id, email, intent, issued_at, expires_at, used_at 
FROM magic_tokens 
ORDER BY issued_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- Check sessions (should have valid expires_at)
SELECT id, user_id, created_at, expires_at 
FROM sessions 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;

-- Check rate limits
SELECT * FROM auth_rate_limits ORDER BY expires_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check audits have user_id
SELECT id, project_id, root_url, user_id, status 
FROM audits 
ORDER BY started_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

### Expected Results:
- ‚úÖ `users` has entries for each email used
- ‚úÖ `magic_tokens` has `used_at` populated after link click
- ‚úÖ `sessions` has valid `expires_at` 30 days in future
- ‚úÖ `auth_rate_limits` tracks attempts per email/IP
- ‚úÖ `audits` has `user_id` matching the authenticated user

---

## üîê Security Validation

### Token Security
- ‚úÖ Raw token only appears in email (never stored in DB)
- ‚úÖ Only token hash (SHA-256) stored in DB
- ‚úÖ Tokens are single-use (marked `used_at` after verification)
- ‚úÖ Tokens expire after 20 minutes
- ‚úÖ Expired tokens cannot be used (checked via `expires_at > now()`)

### Cookie Security
- ‚úÖ Cookies are `HttpOnly` (not accessible via JavaScript)
- ‚úÖ Cookies are `Secure` (HTTPS only)
- ‚úÖ Cookies use `SameSite=Lax` (CSRF protection)
- ‚úÖ Cookies have 30-day TTL (sliding session)

### Rate Limiting
- ‚úÖ Max 5 requests per hour per email
- ‚úÖ Max 10 requests per hour per IP (to allow shared networks)
- ‚úÖ Always return 200 (prevent email enumeration)

### Ownership
- ‚úÖ Audits filtered by `user_id` on list endpoint
- ‚úÖ Direct audit access verifies ownership (if implemented)
- ‚úÖ Deep links verify ownership before redirect

---

## üìä Monitoring & Telemetry

### Logs to Check (via `wrangler tail`)

```
[AUTH] Magic link sent to user@example.com (intent: start_audit)
[AUTH] User verified: user@example.com (intent: start_audit)
[AUTH] Audit abc-123 created for user xyz-789
[AUTH] Rate limit exceeded for email: spammer@example.com
```

### Metrics to Track

| Metric                   | How to Check                                   |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Magic links sent         | `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM magic_tokens`            |
| Magic links used         | `WHERE used_at IS NOT NULL`                    |
| Magic links expired      | `WHERE expires_at < datetime('now')`           |
| Active sessions          | `WHERE expires_at > datetime('now')`           |
| Rate limit hits          | `SELECT * FROM auth_rate_limits WHERE count > 5` |
| Audits created per user  | `SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) FROM audits GROUP BY user_id` |

---

## üêõ Known Issues / Edge Cases

### 1. Audit Processing Not Triggered
**Issue:** After magic link verification, audit is created with `status: 'running'`, but processing doesn't start automatically.

**Workaround:** The backend needs to trigger the audit processing pipeline (e.g., via `fetch()` back to the worker or `waitUntil()` in the verify handler).

**TODO:** Add background processing trigger in `handleMagicLinkVerify`.

---

### 2. Email Delivery Delays
**Issue:** SMTP2GO delivery can take 1-2 minutes in rare cases.

**Workaround:** Check spam folder, wait up to 5 minutes.

**Mitigation:** Add email delivery status polling or webhook from SMTP2GO.

---

### 3. Multiple Audits with Same Domain
**Issue:** Users can create multiple audits for the same domain.

**Decision:** This is by design (users may want to audit the same domain over time).

---

### 4. No Password Reset
**Issue:** Magic links are passwordless, but if a user loses access to their email, they cannot recover their account.

**Workaround:** Email is the primary identity. No password reset needed.

**Future:** Add multi-email support or OAuth for backup.

## üìû Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: "Email not received"**
- Check spam folder
- Verify SMTP2GO API key is correct
- Check SMTP2GO dashboard for delivery status
- Verify email address is valid

**Issue: "Link expired"**
- Links expire in 20 minutes
- Request a new link
- Check system clock (time skew can cause issues)

**Issue: "Audit not appearing in list"**
- Verify `user_id` was set correctly during creation
- Check session cookie is being sent
- Verify audit ownership query is correct

**Issue: "Rate limit hit unexpectedly"**
- Check if multiple devices/browsers are sharing same IP
- Wait 1 hour for rate limit to reset
- Contact admin to manually reset if needed
